# Android Immersive Mode Sample
Android 4.4 Immersive Mode Toolbar Port

This is direct port from Holo theme to Material Design Toolbar.

With Android 4.4(API Level 19) KitKat, your apps can now truly go full-screen with a new Immersive Mode. Immersive Mode lets your apps hide the system's status and navigation bars while capturing all touch eventsâ€”ideal for rich interactive content such as books and games. This video demonstrates how to use the new API, in addition to recapping earlier full-screen APIs on Android.
